# Welcome to Quantum
This repo is just for exploring quantum applications for Summer of 2022.

## Perfect State Transfer
Exploring the existence of multiple perfect state transfer in graphs.
- Currently exploring generalized stars of 5 nodes, 5 edges, one of which is bidirectional.

## QuantumML
Messing with Qiskit to build a quantum circuit that supports ML algorithms such as all subsets regression.
- Currently starting simple with running quantum assisted support vector machines.
