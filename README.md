# Welcome to Quantum
Under the supervision of Dr. Jeremie Fish and Dr. Mahesh Banavar of Clarkson University.

Perfect state transfer is noted through the analysis of matrix exponentials over time. As the matrix exponential value of a particular element
approaches one, it is likely to see PST occur on that node and edge. In this project, optimal graphs will be explored for connections between
optimality and PST.

Fast fourier transforms have been shown to increase in speed with quantum assistance, but the conversion of classical to quantum and quantum
to classical states has been proven as nullifying towards the speed improvement of the steps between. The goal of this project is to implement
simple (SVM) to more complex (All-Subsets) machine learning algorithms and analyze the ability for quantum assistance to truly assist.

## Perfect State Transfer
- Currently exploring generalized stars of 5 nodes, 5 edges, one of which is bidirectional.

## QuantumML
- Currently starting simple with running quantum assisted support vector machines.
